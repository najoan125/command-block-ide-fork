## FAQ

#### How do you make a command block conditional?

Shift-click on the command block icon in the GUI.

#### What is the `commandblockide.bin` file in my game directory?

It's used to store the multi-line versions of commands, since Minecraft
doesn't natively support them. If this file is deleted, all commands
will be collapsed to their single-line versions.

#### Why can't other players see multi-line commands in multiplayer?

Multi-line commands are stored in the `commandblockide.bin` file on your
computer, which is not synced to other players in multiplayer. If you
need to work on commands collaboratively, you will have to stick to
single-line commands for the time being.

#### Why has my multi-line command been collapsed to one line?

Either the single-line and multi-line versions of the command are out of
sync or there is no multi-line version available. This can happen when
logging in to Minecraft from a different computer or when another player
edits the command.

#### Can you port this to Forge?

No.

#### Can you port this to *\<older Minecraft version>*?

No.

#### Can you update this to *\<newer Minecraft version>*?

Maybe.
